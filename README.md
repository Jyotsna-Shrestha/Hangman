# Hangman Game
A simple Hangman game developed using Python. In this guessing game, the player must guess a word by suggesting letters within a certain number of attempts. 

## How to Play

1.	The game will randomly select a word to guess, which is represented by a row of dashes representing each letter of the word.
2.	You have a total of six attempts to guess the letters in the word. 
3.	If the guessed letter is in the word, it will appear in all its correct positions in place of the dashes. If not, you will lose one attempt and one element of a hanged stick figure will be added on the screen.
4.	Continue guessing letters until you run out of attempts or fill in all the blank spaces.
5.	If you guess the word within the given attempts, you win! Otherwise, you lose the game.
